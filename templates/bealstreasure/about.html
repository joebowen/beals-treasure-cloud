                <h3>About Captain Joe:</h3>
    
                <p>
                    Joe Bowen (aka Captain Joe) was born in Milwaukee, WI
                    in 1985. He grew up for most of his life in Lake Orion, MI. Eventually was able
                    to reach the level of Eagle Scout and graduate high school in 2003. The captain
                    went to college at Purdue University and graduated in 2007 with a Bachelors of
                    Science in Computer Engineering.

                <h3>About Captain Joe's Search for Beal's Treasure:</h3>
    
                <p>The Captain's search for Beal's Treasure began in the
                    Spring of 2013 after reading a news article discussing the math theorem and
                    prize. Previous work done by <a href="http://www.norvig.com/beal.html">Peter
                    Norvig</a> was used in the creation of a first generation program designed
                    to search for the solution that would prove Beal's Conjecture false. This took
                    Peter's single thread program and updated it to run on multiple cores. From
                    there it was expanded to a local cluster with several multi-core servers. This
                    was a great improvement from the single threaded program developed by Peter (it
                    also helped that Peter tested his program on a 400Mhz computer and the Captain
                    was working with much newer hardware). But this still wasn't enough, more had to
                    be done. Thus, the Captain came up with a plan of encouraging others to
                    participate and hopefully becoming more interested in math! </p>
    
                <p>So come join the Captain on his search!</p>
