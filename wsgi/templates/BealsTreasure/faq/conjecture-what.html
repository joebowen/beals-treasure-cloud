                            <p>

                            <p>Beal's Conjucture was created in 1993 by banker Andrew Beal
                                while investigating number theory. A conjucture is a mathematical idea that appears
                                correct although no one is sure. In our case Beal's Conjucture can become accepted as
                                proven through mathematical proofs or disproven through finding a counterexample. Here
                                on our treasure hunt, we are looking for a counterexample to disprove Beal's
                                Conjucture.</p>

                            <p>Beal's Conjucture relies on a main formula:</p>

                            <p><img src="http://www.cyberroadie.org/cgi-bin/mathtex.cgi?A%5Ex%20%2B%20B%5Ey%20%3D%20C%5Ez"
                                         alt="A^x + B^y = C^z"></p>

                            <p>A, B, and C are all positive whole numbers.</p>

                            <p>x, y, and z are all positive whole numbers greater than
                                two.</p>

                            <p>When these conditions are met, Beal's Conjucture says that A,
                                B, and C all have a common prime factor.</p>

                            <p>Having a common prime factor is the same as saying that the
                                greatest common divisor of A, B, and C is one.</p>

                            <p>The program that runs when you click "Search!" is trying lots
                                of various combinations of numbers for A, B, C, x, y, and z. </p>

                            <p>Your computer could be the one to find just the right
                                combination.</p>

                            <p></p></p>
